            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Project</h1>
            <h4> Context </h4>
            <p> We (me and my partner) were asked to create a simple idea for a movie. This means we were making just an introduction, not really going all out to a script or anything. The important part that we were doing was making it look good, and interesting.</p>
            <h4> Planning </h4>
            <p>We organized what each person would do towards everything of the project. This includes the storyline, images, fonts, etc.. The whole project was split into three parts: Story, HTML, and CSS </p>
            <p> The name we decided for was 'The Hourglass Key', which was a name based off of the storyline/introduction of the 'movie'.</p>
            <h4>Content</h4>
            <p> For the story of the project, we broke it down into three sections:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Main screen - Main introduction</li>
                <li>Sequel - Like a different side of the story </li>
                <li> While not really being a part of the story, the questions screen</li>
                <p> Each one of these had it's own HTML</p>
            </ul>
            
            <p> For the HTML section of the project, we broke it down into these 6 sections: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Headings </li>
                <li>Paragraphs</li>
                <li> DIVs and Spans </li>
                <li>Importing fonts </li>
                <li> Inputs (submit buttons, normal buttons, etc..) </li>
                <li> Images (at least two local) </li>
            </ul>
            <p>For the CSS section, we brke it down into these _ sections:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Adjusting headings </li>
                <li> Aligning everything properly </li>
                <li> Making the paragraphs readable by adjusting their size, color, and font for some words (words would be in spans) </li>    
            </ul>
            <h4> Challenges </h4>
            <p> After we were done doing the essentials of the project, we wanted to make it look good and be an overall better design. To do this, outside of our basic knowledge of CSS, we had to get creative. I went on <a href="logomakr.com">logomakr</a> to create a logo for our movie, and then added that image within an href to make it clickable to go back to the main page (since we had 3 different HTML pages). Also, to make the heading more interesting, I searched for a long time to find how to make it gradient, which went really well with the underline. This was the way to make a text gradient that I figured out after ~30 minutes of searching: </p>
            <code>
                background: linear-gradient(to [direction], [color 1], [color 2]); <br> <br>
                background-clip: text; <br> <br>
                -webkite-text-color-fill: transparent;
            </code> <br> <br>
            <h4> |Skills I learned| |Reflection| </h4>
            <p> This project taught me a lot of things, outside of knowing more CSS now, I learned that I <strong>need</strong> to do my own research, and that I <strong>need</strong> to ask questions. This is because knowledge is learned from the knowledeable, if you don't ask questions, you won't learn. Questions are essential to learning and increasing your knowledge in anything, wether that be coding, or anything else in life.</p>
